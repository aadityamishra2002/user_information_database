#CSV Data Import to SQLite Database

This Python script facilitates importing user information (name, email, etc.) from a CSV file into a SQLite database.

#Requirements:

Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
sqlite3 library (included in standard Python installation)

#Additional Notes:

For larger datasets, consider using a more efficient database management system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
You can extend the script to handle different CSV formats, perform data validation, or implement logging for better tracking.
Feel free to contribute or raise issues on this project!
